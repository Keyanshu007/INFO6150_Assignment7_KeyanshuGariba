## 1. Introduction

The Form Page is a simple web page designed to collect user information through a form. It includes form fields for email, name, password, and password confirmation. The page uses JavaScript for real-time form validation and interactivity and is styled using CSS for a visually appealing user experience.

## 2. File Structure

- `index.html`: The HTML file that contains the structure of the web page and the form.
- `form.js`: The JavaScript file responsible for form validation and interactivity.
- `form.css`: The CSS file providing styles and layout for the web page.

## 3. HTML (index.html)

The `index.html` file is the main HTML document. It includes the following sections:

- **Document Type and Language**: Defines the document type as HTML5 and specifies the language as English.
- **Metadata**: Specifies the character encoding, viewport settings, and the page title.
- **Container**: Wraps the content of the page within a container div.
- **Form**: Contains the form with fields for email, name, password, and password confirmation.
- **JavaScript and CSS**: Includes references to external JavaScript and CSS files.

## 4. JavaScript (form.js)

The `form.js` file contains JavaScript code for form validation and interactivity. Key features include:

- Real-time validation of email, name, password, and password confirmation fields.
- Enabling/disabling the "Login" button based on form field validity.
- Handling the "Login" button click, redirecting users if all fields are valid.
