## Stopwatch with Async/Await

This is a simple web-based stopwatch application that uses asynchronous JavaScript (async/await) and Promises to manage timekeeping. It displays the elapsed time in hours, minutes, and seconds. Users can start, stop, and reset the stopwatch. The application also includes a date picker input for selecting a date.

### Getting Started

To run this stopwatch application, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser.

3. You will see the stopwatch interface with the following components:
   - Stopwatch display: Shows the elapsed time in the format `HH:MM:SS`.
   - Date picker: Allows you to select a date.
   - Start button: Starts the stopwatch.
   - Stop button: Pauses the stopwatch.
   - Reset button: Resets the stopwatch to 00:00:00.

### Usage

- Start the Stopwatch:
  - Click the "Start" button to begin the stopwatch. The timer will increment by one second every second.

- Stop the Stopwatch:
  - Click the "Stop" button to pause the stopwatch. You can resume it by clicking the "Start" button again.

- Reset the Stopwatch:
  - Click the "Reset" button to stop the stopwatch and reset the timer to 00:00:00.

- Date Picker:
  - Use the date picker input to select a specific date. The stopwatch is not affected by the selected date but is included for demonstration purposes.

## Simple Calculator Web Application

This is a simple web-based calculator application that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It uses jQuery for DOM manipulation and provides real-time input validation.

### Features

- **User Name Display**: The application welcomes the user by displaying their name. The user's name is obtained from the URL query parameters.

- **Input Validation**: The calculator performs real-time input validation for the number input fields, ensuring that users enter valid numerical values. Error messages are displayed when input is incorrect or missing.

- **Mathematical Operations**: Users can select the mathematical operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division) to perform on the input values. The application calculates and displays the result in real-time.

- **Division by Zero Handling**: The calculator handles division by zero gracefully and displays a message when attempting to divide a number by zero.

### Getting Started

To run this calculator application, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser.

3. Enter your name in the URL query parameter as follows:

#### 1. Introduction

The Form Page is a simple web page designed to collect user information through a form. It includes form fields for email, name, password, and password confirmation. The page uses JavaScript for real-time form validation and interactivity and is styled using CSS for a visually appealing user experience.

#### 2. File Structure

- `index.html`: The HTML file that contains the structure of the web page and the form.
- `form.js`: The JavaScript file responsible for form validation and interactivity.
- `form.css`: The CSS file providing styles and layout for the web page.

#### 3. HTML (index.html)

The `index.html` file is the main HTML document. It includes the following sections:

- **Document Type and Language**: Defines the document type as HTML5 and specifies the language as English.
- **Metadata**: Specifies the character encoding, viewport settings, and the page title.
- **Container**: Wraps the content of the page within a container div.
- **Form**: Contains the form with fields for email, name, password, and password confirmation.
- **JavaScript and CSS**: Includes references to external JavaScript and CSS files.

#### 4. JavaScript (form.js)

The `form.js` file contains JavaScript code for form validation and interactivity. Key features include:

- Real-time validation of email, name, password, and password confirmation fields.
- Enabling/disabling the "Login" button based on form field validity.
- Handling the "Login" button click, redirecting users if all fields are valid.

#### 5. CSS (form.css)

The `form.css` file provides styling and layout for the Form Page. It includes styles for:

- Background color and font family for the entire page.
- Container styles, including text alignment, margins, padding, background color, width, border radius, and box shadow.
- Heading styles, adjusting font size, color, and margin.
- Form, label, and input field styles for a clean and user-friendly appearance.
- Styles for the "Login" button, including its appearance when disabled and enabled.

#### 6. Usage

To use the Form Page, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local environment.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view and interact with the form.
